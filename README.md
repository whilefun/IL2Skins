# IL2Skins
A collection of plane skins for IL-2 Great Battles series


To Use (Starting from existing install with no custom skins):

> Go to your \1C Game Studios\IL-2 Sturmovik Great Battles\data\graphics\ folder
> Rename skins to skinsBackup
> Sync this repo to \1C Game Studios\IL-2 Sturmovik Great Battles\data\graphics\skins\ which will create repo in a new skins folder (since you renamed original skins folder).
> Copy the contents of your skinsBackup folder into the skins folder, but DO NOT overwrite any existing folders pulled from this repo.

You should now have a custom set of skins in sync with this repo. When new or updated skins are available, you should be able to pull from this repo and get the newest stuff. Hooray!
